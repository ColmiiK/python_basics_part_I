# w3resource's Python basics, part I
While also working on my C skills, I'm also trying to diversify and learn other languages, so I decided to start with Python first, since it seems like the logical choice, being the most popular programming language out there.

I'm starting with the basic Python exercises from [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/index.php) because they're simple and it resembles the way of learning that I'm used to from 42 School.

You can find the same exercises that I'm going through [here](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-basic-exercises.php).
